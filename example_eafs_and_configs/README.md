Are you converting EAFs that contain child/learner speech *and* annotations of the target/adult-like form for (at least some) child utterances? 

If so, use the example files in the `has_child_language` directory. 

Otherwise, use the example files in the `no_child_language` directory.

Example files are in Ticuna using an ASCII-only practical orthography. They were created in Cushillococha, Loreto, Peru by the following participants:

* `no_child_language`: Angel Bittancourt Serra (speaker), Nicasio Witancort Gomez (speaker), Lilia Witancort Guerrero (transcriber), Amalia Skilton (researcher). Recorded and transcribed in 2018. Recordings are archived as [California Language Archive 2018-19.003](http://cla.berkeley.edu/item/25464)
* `has_child_language`: Child aged 4 years, 6 months at recording date (speaker); her mother/primary caregiver (speaker); child and adult bystanders (speakers); transcriber; Amalia Skilton (researcher). Recording participants are anonymous due to ethics requirements & transcriber is anonymous by choice. Recorded in 2019 and transcribed in 2022. Recordings are archived as [California Language Archive 2018-19.044](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.7297/X2W66J11)
